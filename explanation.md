# Note to Examiner

First of all, I had to install truffle version 4.1.14
I had to downgrade to node version 10.24.1 through this link(https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/)
Due to the downgrade, I think there is a problem with the truffle and the events coming late so I used the truffle-assertions library to be sure that a particular event was emitted
I had to drag web3(version 0.8) in through cdn in the index.html file, it was used in the web frontend but was not connected, the latest versions of web3 js were not compatible with the truffle-contract.js.
